## About the Project
I'm currently studying data analytics and with it, i want to determine if MMORPG genre will survive in the coming years. I'm an avid fan of mmorpg games and these past few years has been a bit frustrating for the genre as most of the mmorpg games out there are hanging bu a thread except for some huge companies. This is my personal project and the result of this research will help me decide if I want to pursue my 3D career as a game concept artist and designer.
